Description: 
        *docxcompose* is a Python library for concatenating/appending Microsoft
        Word (.docx) files.
        
        
        Example usage
        -------------
        
        Append a document to another document:
        
        .. code::
        
            from docxcompose.composer import Composer
            from docx import Document
            master = Document("master.docx")
            composer = Composer(master)
            doc1 = Document("doc1.docx")
            composer.append(doc1)
            composer.save("combined.docx")
        
        
        The docxcompose console script
        ------------------------------
        
        
        The ``docxcompose`` console script allows to compose docx files from the command
        line, e.g.:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ docxcompose files/master.docx files/content.docx -o files/composed.docx
        
        
        Installation for development
        ----------------------------
        
        To install docxcompose for development, clone the repository and using a python with setuptools (for example a fresh virtualenv), install it using pip:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install -e .[tests]
        
        Tests can then be run with ``pytest``.
        
        
        A note about testing
        --------------------
        
        The tests provide helpers for blackbox testing that can compare whole word
        files. To do so the following files should be provided:
        
        - a file for the expected output that should be added to the folder
          `docs/composed_fixture`
        - multiple files that can be composed into the file above should be added
          to the folder `docs`.
        
        The expected output can now be tested as follows:
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            def test_example():
                fixture = FixtureDocument("expected.docx")
                composed = ComposedDocument("master.docx", "slave1.docx", "slave2.docx")
                assert fixture == composed
        
        
        Should the assertion fail the output file will be stored in the folder
        `docs/composed_debug` with the filename of the fixture file, `expected.docx`
        in case of this example.
